/** @file
 * @brief Stream payload buffering
 *
 * Most of the time, parsing packets one by one is enough. This is fast (we do
 * not need to copy payloads from the pcap buffer) and simple (parsers don't
 * have to handle packets boundaries).
 *
 * But some applicative parsers need to parse payload scattered across packet
 * boundaries. This helper is a simple tool to help them.
 *
 * To use it, first construct a streambuf for your parser (which implies that
 * your parser cannot be unique, which is already certainly the case), giving
 * the constructor a callback and a maximum size to buffer (after which a
 * PROTO_PARSE_ERR will automatically occur).
 *
 * Then, in your parse method, just call streambuf_add with your constructed
 * buffer and all the parse parameters, and your callback will be called with
 * the buffer payload. From there, perform the parse and the call to
 * proto_parse as usual, but in addition, when your parser needs more data to
 * continue, leave the streambuf_cursor to where you would like to resume
 * parsing. Next time (provided you returned PROTO_OK) you will be called with
 * more data, starting to this byte.
