;;; For actions, here we use 'eval' with parameters of various types (eval is a special form which parameters are
;;; evaluated but not type checked, see netmatch.scm).
;;; We could also use 'call' which would call this function with given parameters (it's up to you (and ld) to
;;; ensure this call will eventually succeed). See netmatch.scm for these (and others) interesting special forms...
